Two Optimization Case Studies done in this course.  

Our Tasks for two case studies would be formulate the question, specify the constraints, solve the problem using Ampl and make sensitivity analysis.
Case 1: Help Calgary Desk Company to make a production schedule in order to fulfill the production requirement while maximizing profits, under constraints.
Case 2: Help Lake Saddleback Development Corporation to develop a construction plan for a community under multiply constraints. The aim is to maximize the selling profits while fulfilling the requirements. 

More details about the two case studies are included in the project detail files.
